    description: `Hi, I’m Satomi.
I used to study English literature, but now I’m a network engineer-in-training, living in Canada.
I dropped out of university in Japan and jumped into the IT world here in Canada. After learning the basics of web development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m now focusing on network engineering and working toward my CCNA certification. And yes, I try not to break any routers in the process (lol).

This blog is where I share my real-life journey from a liberal arts background to tackling the IT industry abroad, how networks are built, and sometimes a few personal stories along the way.

If any of that catches your attention, feel free to check it out.
For those who are new to IT, curious about studying abroad, or just want to join me on this wild ride, let’s enjoy the journey together! 🌍💻 `,
