### Hi! This is my first post on my blog.
There’s a lot I’d like to share about myself, so feel free to sit back and enjoy this section!

## About Me
My name is Satomi Hachisuka. I was born and raised in a rural area of Japan.
Did you notice the bee on my top page? That’s actually my personal symbol! The reason is simple—“Hachi” (part of my last name) means “bee” in Japanese 🐝

Back in high school, I didn’t really have a specific dream, but I liked studying English. Naturally, I ended up majoring in English literature at university.

In my third year, I took a class on AI technology, and it gradually sparked my interest in how the world of technology works. At the same time, I enjoyed speaking English with people from other countries.
That led me to take a year off from university and study IT abroad.

## Why Canada?
Why Canada?
Well, the IT industry in North America is highly developed, but I heard that Canada is safer than the U.S.—and that was a big factor for me. So I chose Vancouver!

In January 2024, I started attending a language school in downtown Vancouver for two months. Then in April, I enrolled in a private college to study web development.
Everything was new and exciting, and I really enjoyed the classes.

At first, I wasn’t planning to do a co-op program (working after studying).
But after spending a year here, by January 2025, I realized that I wanted to stay longer and work in Canada.
I had completely fallen in love with the people and the lifestyle here!

## From Web Dev to Network Engineering
This decision was a huge step in my life.
I didn’t have any work experience—even in Japan—and I had been studying English literature in university.
But I truly wanted to work here. That strong motivation pushed me to start studying for the CCNA certification.

Yes, I was studying web development at first.
I really enjoyed coding and creating websites.
But one day, I started to wonder: “Why can I connect to the internet?”
So I asked a friend who was studying networking. He explained how the internet actually works.

I was shocked to learn that there are undersea cables connecting the world’s internet.
It blew my mind and got me super curious.
From that day on, I started researching networks—and before I knew it, I was already studying CCNA.

That’s how I fell into the world of IT.

##  Final Thoughts


I love learning new things that make me excited!
Studying for CCNA changed my life and made it more colorful.
The more I study computer science, the more I like myself.
That’s why I’m here in Canada.

Thanks so much for reading 🧡
